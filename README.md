Google is a globally recognized search engine and an industry giant,
in fact, even the second biggest “search engine” is Google Images, according to this study:



DuckDuckGo is a popular search engine for those who value their
 privacy and are put off by the thought of their every query being tracked and logged.

It has a very clean interface with minimal ads and infinite scrolling,
 so the user experience is nice and streamlined. There’s absolutely
 zero user tracking,
 and you can even add DuckDuckGo’s extension to your browser to 
keep your activity private.

The search engine has a really useful feature called bangs, which allows
 you to search directly within another website from DuckDuckGo by typing a
 prefix. For example, typing “!ebay magic the gathering” would take you directly
 to eBay’s search results for the query “magic the gathering”.
